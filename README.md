# Hanging Campus Board
Contains Fusion 360 and SketchUp(untested) projects for my "hanging" 9-rung sit-start campus board.

The campus board has two mounts on each side that allow it to connect to a wall or wood beam. I suggest using a 12" sling and two carabiners to achieve the 15-20 degree overhang.

Rung Spacing is 22cm(standard) appart and the rungs used are  [Tension Climbing Rungs](https://www.tensionclimbing.com/product/standard-rungs/); Rung Length: 16" | Rung Depth: Medium.

For the board I used 3/4" untreated plywood, and the rest are 2x4.

## Modifying the board

Because I'm using variables and functions to determine the measurements, you should be able to adjust values such as rung count and the model will resize itself accordingly.
