# Hanging Campus Board
Contains Fusion 360 and SketchUp(untested) project for my "hanging" 9-rung campus board.

The campus board has two mounts on each side that allow it to connect to a wall or wood beam. I suggest using a 12" sling and two carabiners to achieve the 15-20 degree overhang.

Rung Spacing is 22cm(standard) appart and the rungs used are  [Tension Climbing Rungs](https://www.tensionclimbing.com/product/standard-rungs/); Rung Length: 16" | Rung Depth: Medium.

For the board I used 3/4" untreated plywood, and the rest are 2x4.
